Career Guidance System
The Career Guidance System is a dynamic full-stack web application developed using the Django framework. The primary objective of this project is to assist students and aspiring professionals in discovering and navigating the right career paths based on their current academic level and future aspirations. Whether a user is in Class 10, Class 12, or pursuing higher education, the platform offers personalized career roadmaps and curated learning resources to help them make informed decisions.

This system bridges the gap between career uncertainty and structured planning. Upon registration, users are guided through an interactive dashboard where they can choose their current level of education and the field or profession they are interested in. Based on these inputs, the platform displays tailored career roadmapsâ€”step-by-step guides containing relevant courses, tools, skills, and platforms needed to pursue that career.

In addition to the user module, the system includes a powerful admin panel that allows administrators to upload, edit, and organize career content, learning resources, and roadmaps without writing any code. All data is stored securely in a MySQL database, and the front-end is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive user experience.

The project follows clean coding practices and incorporates essential web development features such as authentication, form validation, session handling, template inheritance, and content filtering. It serves as a practical solution for educational institutions, career counselors, or individuals seeking structured, self-paced career guidance.

This project reflects my learning and skills in full-stack development and demonstrates how Django can be used to solve real-world problems through scalable and maintainable solutions.
